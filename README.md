# LeetCode DSA Solutions 👨‍💻

This repository contains solutions to a wide range of LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The goal is to practice and master key concepts such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

Solutions are implemented in multiple languages, with **C++** as the primary language.

Files are named using the format: `problem_id. Problem Title.extension` for easy identification and navigation.

## How to Use
1. Browse the repository files (sorted by name to see problems in numerical order).
2. Click on any file to view the complete, self-contained solution.
3. Run locally:
   - **C++ / C**: Compile with `g++` or `gcc`  
     Example: `g++ "123. Problem Title.cpp" -o solution && ./solution`
   - **Python**: `python "123. Problem Title.py"`
   - **Java**: `javac "123. Problem Title.java" && java "ProblemTitle"`
4. Copy the code directly into the LeetCode editor to test or submit.

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! You can:
- Add solutions for new problems
- Optimize existing solutions
- Improve code readability or add detailed comments
- Fix bugs

**Guidelines**:
- Follow the naming convention: `problem_id. Problem Title.extension`
- Include comments explaining the approach and time/space complexity when possible
- Ensure the code passes all LeetCode test cases

Submit a pull request and it will be reviewed promptly.
